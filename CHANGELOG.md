# CHANGELOG

## Refactoring and Modernization (2025-12-26)

### Situation
The Task Manager app had a fragmented multi-window UI, cramped visuals, and lacked key process details.

### Task
Consolidate UX into a single window, modernize the design, and add grouping/network metrics.

### Action
Refactored to a single WPF window, implemented white theme with increased padding, added icon extraction, and integrated network monitoring logic.

### Result
A cohesive, user-friendly application with improved readability and real-time network insights.
